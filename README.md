# Experiments with `big_vision`

Contains my experiments with the [`big_vision`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision) repository to train ViTs on ImageNet-1k.

## What is `big_vision`?

From the repository:

> This codebase is designed for training large-scale vision models on Cloud TPU VMs. It is based on Jax/Flax libraries, and uses tf.data and TensorFlow Datasets for scalable input pipelines in the Cloud.

> big_vision aims to support research projects at Google. We are unlikely to work on feature requests or accept external contributions, unless they were pre-approved (ask in an issue first).
